# Cashback Trading Platform (رفيق الكاش باك)

## Overview
A Next.js-based cashback platform for traders, designed to reward users with cashback on every trade. The application provides a comprehensive loyalty and referral system, robust authentication, and trading account management. The business vision is to capture a significant market share in the trading cashback sector by offering a secure, feature-rich, and user-friendly experience.

## User Preferences
All server actions are secure with proper authentication. The system prioritizes security with Row Level Security (RLS) policies, secure cookie-based authentication, and comprehensive verification across the platform. The system is production-ready with modern best practices.

## System Architecture
The platform is built with Next.js 15.3.3 and Turbopack, using TypeScript and styled with TailwindCSS and Radix UI components. Supabase PostgreSQL serves as the database, with Supabase Auth handling user authentication (Email/Password, OAuth providers). State management is handled with React Context (useAuthContext). AI features are integrated using Google Genkit.

**UI/UX Decisions:**
- Multi-language support with Arabic/English and RTL layout.
- Radix UI primitives are used for UI components, with custom styling.

**Technical Implementations & Feature Specifications:**
- User authentication and authorization with Supabase Auth and secure SSR cookie handling.
- Trading account management, including broker integration and a submission/approval workflow.
- Cashback calculation, tracking, and a loyalty points/tier system.
- Referral program with commission tracking.
- Admin dashboard for comprehensive management of users, brokers, and transactions.
- Content management features including a blog system with Markdown support.
- E-commerce functionality with a store/marketplace.
- Activity logging for security tracking.
- Geo-location services for user registration via IP detection.

**System Design Choices:**
- **Security-first approach:** Row Level Security (RLS) policies on all 19 database tables, Supabase Auth with SSR, and secure server actions.
- **Server Actions:** All critical user-scoped operations use secure server actions with proper authentication.
- **Database Design:** PostgreSQL with proper indexing, foreign keys, and ENUM types for data integrity.
- **Project Structure:** Organized into `src/app` for routes, `src/components` for UI, `src/lib` for utilities, `src/hooks` for custom hooks, and `src/types` for TypeScript definitions.

## External Dependencies
- **Supabase:** PostgreSQL database, Authentication (user auth), Row Level Security.
- **Next.js:** Web framework (15.3.3 with Turbopack).
- **TailwindCSS:** Styling framework.
- **Radix UI:** UI component library.
- **Google Genkit:** AI integration.
- **IPinfo.io:** Geo-location services (server-side with `IPINFO_TOKEN`).

## Replit Environment Setup

### Development Server
- **Workflow:** "Server" running `npm run dev`
- **Port:** 5000 (configured to bind to 0.0.0.0)
- **Host Configuration:** Next.js configured with `allowedDevOrigins: ['*.replit.dev']` to work with Replit's proxy

### Required Environment Variables
The following environment variables must be configured in Replit Secrets:

**Supabase Configuration:**
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` - Your Supabase project URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Supabase anonymous/public key
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - Supabase service role key (for admin operations)

**Optional Services:**
- `IPINFO_TOKEN` - IPinfo.io API token for geo-location services
- `COOKIE_SIGNATURE_KEYS` - Legacy variable (not used in Supabase migration)

### Deployment Configuration
- **Target:** Autoscale (stateless web application)
- **Build Command:** `npm run build`
- **Run Command:** `npm start`

### Database Schema Validation
**Automated Validation Script:** `scripts/validate-database-schema.sh`
- Run before deploying to catch schema mismatches
- Validates that code expectations match database reality
- Checks critical tables and column names
- **Key Schema Rules:**
  - `feedback_forms` uses `is_active` (boolean), NOT `status`
  - `offers` uses `is_enabled` (boolean), NOT `is_active`
  - `users`, `trading_accounts`, `withdrawals` use `status` (enum)
  - `blog_posts`, `orders` use `status` (text)

**Run validation:** `bash scripts/validate-database-schema.sh`

### Database Setup - COMPLETE SOLUTION
**File:** `supabase_schema.sql` (TESTED AND VERIFIED)

**Setup Instructions:**
1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to SQL Editor (left sidebar)
4. Click "New Query"
5. Copy **ENTIRE** content of `supabase_schema.sql`
6. Paste and click "Run"
7. Wait for "Success" message

**What This Creates:**
- 19 tables with correct column names (NO MORE STATUS ERRORS)
- All indexes for performance
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Seed data (client levels, default settings)

**Column Name Reference (MEMORIZE THIS):**
- `feedback_forms` → uses `is_active` (boolean)
- `offers` → uses `is_enabled` (boolean)
- `users` → uses `status` (enum: active/suspended/inactive)
- `trading_accounts` → uses `status` (enum: Pending/Approved/Rejected)
- `withdrawals` → uses `status` (enum: Processing/Completed/Failed)
- `blog_posts` → uses `status` (text: draft/published)
- `orders` → uses `status` (text)

**VERIFIED:** This schema file has been tested and contains ZERO column mismatch errors.

### KYC Document Upload Adjustments
**File:** `kyc_document_upload_adjustments.sql` (RUN AFTER MAIN SCHEMA)

**Purpose:** Enhances KYC/Address verification system for simplified user upload flow

**What This Adds:**
1. **Driver's License Support:** Extends `document_type` enum to include 'driver_license' (was only id_card, passport)
2. **Selfie Verification:** Adds optional `kyc_selfie_url` column for enhanced identity verification
3. **Workflow Documentation:** Comprehensive comments explaining user-upload vs admin-review separation
4. **Performance Indexes:** Adds indexes on verification status columns for faster admin queries

**Workflow Clarification:**
- **User Side:** Upload documents only (document type + country + images)
- **Admin Side:** Review documents and extract personal data (name, DOB, document numbers, etc.)

**Run After:** Main schema is set up. This is a safe migration that extends existing functionality.
